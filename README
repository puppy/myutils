In library git-core, git has a command that makes all the commits appearing in graphs.

For example:
git log --graph --all

It is an other matter to make readable graphs. For that purpose, the following command is helpful to setup a special alias:
git config alias.graph "log --graph --date-order -C -M --pretty=format:\"<%h> %ad [%an] %Cgreen%d%Creset %s\" --all --date=short"

Then this command based on the alias above prints nice-looking graphs.
git graph
